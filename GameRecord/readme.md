Step 1: GitHub Connection:
Set up Git locally and connected it to a GitHub repo
Committed all project files so the code is version-controlled and backed up online

Step 2: Game Class Setup:
Looked at the example.json file to understand how the game data is structured
Created a Game class in models/Game.js that matches the structure (with properties like title, designer, rating, etc.)
Exported the class and imported it into app.mjs to create game instances from the JSON data
